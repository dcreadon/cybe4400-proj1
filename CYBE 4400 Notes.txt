------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sample.c file in linux-2.6.23/security is a completed file
look over it and implement your own cw-lite code into sample.c file
after that, go to bed

tomorrow:
figure out how the fuck this makefile and make bullshit works
once that is done need to test the code and see if it is working as expected.
